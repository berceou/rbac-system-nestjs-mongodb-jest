# RBAC System With NestJS & MongoDB

Develop a Role-Based Access Control System with Jest Testing using Typescript, NestJS, MongoDB. The task includes building a role-based access control system with three roles - Store Manager, Global Admin, and Normal User. The system will have two entities - Store and Product.
The Global Admin role will be able to create stores and create other users (Store Managers and Normal Users). The Store Manager role will be able to create products for their respective stores. The Normal User role will be able to view all products in all stores.
The system should include authentication to ensure that only authorized users are able to access the relevant features.
